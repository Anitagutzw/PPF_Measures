# PPF-Measures
This repository contains the Python code and resources related to the Master's thesis "Quantitative Measures of Drug Resistance Using Stochastic Processes" by Anita Gutzwiller, supervised by Prof. Dr. Riccardo Gatto at the University of Bern.

The thesis introduces a novel mathematical framework that bridges stochastic process theory, coherent risk measures, and clinical decision-making to address timing-related uncertainties in medical treatment, particularly focusing on drug resistance.
